```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(agricolae)  # For interaction plot
```

## Load and Prepare Data
```{r}
# Load dataset
# The dataset is stored in the Downloads > GRA 4158 > Task3 folder

df <- read.csv("~/Downloads/GRA 4158/Task3/Multifactorial_design_example.csv", sep = ";")

# Convert categorical variables to factors
df$messagetype <- as.factor(df$messagetype)
df$pricelevel <- as.factor(df$pricelevel)

# View first few rows
head(df)
```

## Summary Statistics
```{r}
# Calculate group-wise means, standard deviations, and sample sizes
group_summary <- df %>%
  group_by(messagetype, pricelevel) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_response = mean(response),
    sd_response = sd(response),
    count = n()
  )

# Display the summary
group_summary
```

## Two-Way ANOVA
```{r}
# Fit a two-way ANOVA model with interaction term
anova_model <- aov(response ~ messagetype * pricelevel, data = df)

# View summary of the ANOVA
summary(anova_model)
```

## Post-hoc Test: Tukey HSD
```{r}
# Conduct Tukey HSD post-hoc comparisons
TukeyHSD(anova_model)
```

## Diagnostic Plots
```{r}
# Residuals vs Fitted
plot(anova_model, which = 1)

# Q-Q Plot for normality
plot(anova_model, which = 2)
```

## Interaction Plot
```{r}
# Plot the interaction between message type and price level
interaction.plot(
  x.factor = df$pricelevel,
  trace.factor = df$messagetype,
  response = df$response,
  fun = mean,
  type = "b",
  col = c("blue", "red"),
  pch = c(16, 17),
  xlab = "Price Level",
  ylab = "Mean Response",
  trace.label = "Message Type",
  main = "Interaction Plot: Message Type Ã— Price Level"
)
```

## Conclusion
```{r}
cat("Both messagetype and pricelevel significantly affect the response.\n")
cat("There is also a significant interaction between them.\n")
cat("This suggests marketers should carefully pair messages with the right price strategy.\n")
